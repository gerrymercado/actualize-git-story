This is a story about an ambitious young kid that dreamed big. He couldn't see the whole picture as he grew up but he knew his life had a special purpose which he constantly pondered on. His passion showed when he did martial arts and played basketball. He would zone in and give it his all. He confronted his first fear of sparring even though it took him many years to get through it. He would tell his mom at times that he didn't want to go to class on Friday but his mom would encourage him to go. All his friends played soccer but he always felt a stronger connection to basketball once his dad bought him his first court at the age of 8.
